                <p>CTK 201: Basic Skills In The Digital Arts was an introductory course I took my first semester in the Creative Technologies program at Illinois State University.<br>
                In this course, we were encouraged to work in multiple mediums, and share our work with our peers!</p>

                        <p>For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a fictional artist, along with works to fit the narrative of our characters!<br>In my case, I decided to make an urban photographer focused on lighting, and making dramatic art out of the mundane.</p>

                        <p>For this assignment, we were tasked with working on a project of our choice for five minutes each day over the course of a week.<br>
                            Though it's not as polished as I would like, I think this is a decent showcase of my illustration skills! It also showcases my experience with
                            art software such as Krita, the main program I used to make this piece!

                        <p>This was a result of our emulation assignment, where we were asked to recreate the style of another artist. 
                            <br>I chose to make a poster based on the work of Jason Galea, the artist behind most of the album and poster art for the band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard!

                        <p>In addition to the photography showcased before, I created a second artist known for graffiti in the city.
                            <br>Of course, I wasn't going to go and make my own graffiti, risking vandalism charges. So I decided to use this as a chance to test out my photoshop skills instead! I began by taking pictures, before drawing my own "graffiti" and editing it into my photos.
                            <br>If you look closely, you might just spot it on the right side of the bridge's underside!

                <p>In CTK 240: Beginning Digital Audio, we learned the basics of sound engineering and learned to work in Adobe Audition.
                    <br>Here's some examples of my work to show my progress!
                </p>
                    <article class="work">
                        <h4>Beautiful-Terrible</h4>
                        <h5>Beautiful</h5>
                        <audio controls autobuffer><source src="Class work/CTK 240/Beautiful Terrible/Beautiful.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>

                        <audio controls autobuffer><source src="Class work/CTK 240/Beautiful Terrible/TerribleSound.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio>
                        <p>Our first assignment, with the goal of getting us familiar with Audtion as a DAW, was to make two sounds:
                            <br>one pleasant and beautiful, and another as abbrasive and objectively bad as possible.
                            <br>Due to web compression, you might have to download the terrible sound for the full effect...
                        </p>

                        <p>For our second assignment, we were required to use EQ filters to transform an existing song into three different styles.
                            <br>In my case, I chose to work from Splatoon 3's character customization background music, with the goals of creating three segments which sounded withered, powerful, and distant respectively.

                        <h4>Underscore</h4>
                        <p>The third project in this class was to take a vocal track, and underscore it with three different tracks. 
                            <br>I chose to do so with the iconinc "I am the danger" speech from Breaking Bad, first underscored with an ambient track from Splatoon 1:

                        <p>I also did so with the background music used for Nook's Cranny in Animal Crossing:</p>

                        <p>And the song "Bear With Me" from Splatoon 3!</p>

                        <p>For this assignment, we were tasked with editing an existing song to be less than two minutes. so of course, I decided to challenge myself by working with a piece that was 18 minutes long! (The Dripping Tap by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard)
                            <br>Of course, there was a lot more which I wish I could've included... But I guess you'll have to go listen to the full song yourself to hear all of that!

                        <p>And now for my final assignment in this class...
                            <br>To end the semester and show everything we learned, each of us was asked to create a narrative through sound effects. For my project, I chose to tell the story of a spy escaping a warehouse!
                            <br>Or at least, attempting to escape...
